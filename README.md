# Firebase Login & Registration App

This app is a smaller section of a larger app I am working on. In this app, new users can register, and existing users (or newly registered users) can log in.
This is all done using Google's Firebase.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Computer with 4GB RAM or above is ideal
Android Studios software https://developer.android.com/studio/?gclid=CjwKCAiA6bvwBRBbEiwAUER6JU-n5T0UOyNUNG58KgPhCOcXDai5imo3sG44nyhyqvv_TkEQmyzlWBoC5O0QAvD_BwE

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Step 1 - Set up your own Firebase Project in https://firebase.google.com/

```
Follow the instructions to init a new Android project
Make sure to replace my google-services.json file with the one you need to download
```

Step 2 - Enable Email/Password signup method to accept new users

```
Go to your project, Authentication->Sign-in Method->Email/Password->Enable
```

If you followed Firebase instructions, and you are using my code, just connect your Android phone, click run on Android Studio and the app will deploy on your phone. Also works with emulator.
